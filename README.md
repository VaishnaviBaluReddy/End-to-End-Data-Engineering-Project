# End-to-End-Data-Engineering-Project

This project shows the process converting an input json file into csv file in Azure Data Factory. Data Cleaning is then performed on this output file in Databricks with the help of Pyspark and SQL. Using Tableau, we then provide easy to understand reports of our data.

This end-to-end data processing and visualization project aims to streamline the data journey from its raw form to actionable insights. By combining the capabilities of Azure Data Factory, Databricks, Pyspark SQL, and Tableau, the project empowers users to gain deeper insights into their data, identify trends, detect anomalies, and uncover valuable patterns that can drive business growth and efficiency.
